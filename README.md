# Prime Gaps Line

This repository is in response to the Stand-up Maths video at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMsTXQYgbiQ, specifically intended to answer
the question

"I have no idea what the shape will be. Does the line get thicker and thicker,
meaning the top pointy bit will travel that way, or does the shape change? I
don't know: I looked around, I couldn't find out. If you know, let me know."
